# WebCrawler101
This chunk of code here crawls the web for the desired data/piece of information needed.


This piece of code acts as a spider which crawls the website gathering required piece of information needed.
In this case, this is more static as it seems to crawl only one page at a time.

The url's used here points to the Women's lingerie section of India's finest marketplace i.e Flipkart
and gathers the links as well as the Header for all the diaplayed lingerie in that page. Pretty Cool eh?

This code is purely meant for educational purposes only and nothing else.
It's still under development and the later ones will become available as WebCrawler102,103 or so I hope

The code is edited and written in Python3.6, and the modules used were 
1.requests
2.BeautifulSoup4


P.S:- Don't judge me! It was only piece of idea I could think of at that moment
